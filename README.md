Some code to find Java hashCode() collisions.

`cz.topolik.hashcodecollisions.StringHashCodeCollisionsMutator` to find collisions by mutating some word - mangles the word but keeps length

**Example:**
```
mvn package

java -cp target/*.jar cz.topolik.hashcodecollisions.StringHashCodeCollisionsMutator machinator 4

`cz.topolik.hashcodecollisions.StringHashCodeCollisionsPostfixator` to find collisions to original word by creating a postfix of chosen word
